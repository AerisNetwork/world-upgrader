# worldupgrader
Upgrade Minecraft Bedrock Edition worlds to the latest version.

Block state upgrading is heavily inspired by [PMMP's block state conversion code](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/tree/major-next/src/data/bedrock/block/upgrade) and uses
their [block state upgrade schemas](https://github.com/pmmp/BedrockBlockUpgradeSchema) at heart.
